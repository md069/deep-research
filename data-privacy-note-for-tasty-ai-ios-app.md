## 1. Introduction and Scope [2][12]

Tasty AI (“the App”) is an iOS AI Cooking Companion designed to assist users in personalizing their culinary experience through interactive recipe suggestions, dietary preference analyses, and the delivery of engaging content. Our commitment to maintaining transparency and ensuring compliance with all applicable data protection regulations—most notably the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Germany’s Bundesdatenschutzgesetz (BDSG), the Apple App Store privacy requirements, and relevant U.S. privacy laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)/California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)—underpins the content of this Data Privacy Note [2][12].

This note outlines our data collection, processing practices, and procedures that have been established to minimize potential liability and maximize legal protection for our business operations. The policies stated herein apply not only to direct interactions through our App but also to any data shared with our trusted third-party service providers, including analytics and payment processing partners [2][3].

---

## 2. Data Collection [2][7]

We collect personal data for two main purposes: to provide an enhanced, personalized cooking companion experience and to comply with regulatory obligations. Data is segregated primarily into two categories:

### 2.1 Data You Provide [2][7]

- **Account Information:** When you register for an account, we collect data such as your name, email address, and password [2].
- **User-Submitted Content:** This includes photos and text input provided for recipe analysis and culinary feedback [2].
- **Payment Information:** In instances when you subscribe to premium features, payment data is collected and processed through third-party providers such as Superwall and RevenueCat [2][7].

### 2.2 Automatically Collected Data [2][7]

- **Usage Data:** Information regarding your interactions with the App, including which features are used, session duration, user navigation patterns, and behavior analytics tracked through Mixpanel and Smartlook [2][7].
- **Device Information:** Data such as device type, operating system, unique device identifiers, and diagnostic data that is collected automatically when the App is in use [2][7].
- **Log Data:** This includes IP addresses, timestamps, and other technical data relevant to your access and use of our service; this may involve third-party services like Firebase Functions [2][7].

---

## 3. Legal Basis for Processing [2][4]

For each category of personal data collected, our processing activities rely on a combination of the following legal bases, detailed below in accordance with GDPR and other applicable regulations [2][4]:

- **Consent:** Explicit consent is obtained from the user for data processing activities that require it, such as tracking usage data through Mixpanel and Smartlook. Mechanisms are in place to allow easy withdrawal of consent at any time [2][9].
- **Contractual Necessity:** Data required for account management and premium feature delivery (including payment processing through providers like Superwall and RevenueCat) is processed based on contractual obligations [2][4].
- **Legitimate Interests:** Some data processing, such as improving the App’s functionality and the overall user experience, is conducted on the basis of our legitimate interests. Regular assessments are conducted to ensure these interests do not override user rights [2][10].
- **Legal Obligations:** In compliance with statutory obligations under GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, and other relevant regulations, data may be processed as necessary for legal compliance [2][11].

---

## 4. Purpose of Data Processing [2][7]

We collect and process data for the following specific purposes:

- **Account Management:** To enable you to create an account, login securely, and manage your profile and subscription services [2][7].
- **Personalized Recipe Suggestions:** The data collected is used to tailor content and recommendations specific to your dietary preferences and interaction history [2][7].
- **Payment and Transaction Processing:** Handling payments for premium content via secure third-party channels ensures smooth and efficient transactions without storing unnecessary financial data [2].
- **Security, Analytics, and App Functionality:** Collected usage, device, and diagnostic data are used to monitor app performance, conduct troubleshooting, and enhance your overall experience. This includes insight from analytics and behavior tracking services [2][6].

---

## 5. Data Subject Rights [2][12]

Under GDPR and similar data privacy frameworks, users benefit from robust rights concerning their personal data. In our commitment to transparency and user control, the following rights are provided:

- **Right of Access:** Users may request access to the data we have collected about them [2][12].
- **Right to Correction:** Inaccurate or incomplete information can be rectified upon user request [2][12].
- **Right to Deletion (“Right to be Forgotten”):** Users may request deletion of their personal data where applicable [2][12].
- **Right to Restrict Processing:** Users can request limitations on how data is processed [2][12].
- **Right to Object:** Users have the right to object to data processing based on legitimate interests or direct marketing requirements [2][12].
- **Right to Data Portability:** Users can request that their data be provided in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format [2][12].
- **Right to Withdraw Consent:** At any stage, users may withdraw previously granted consent for data processing; instructions on how to do this are detailed in our Consent Management section [2][9].

Instructions for exercising these rights include contacting us via the provided details, accompanied by verification of identity where necessary. Users are encouraged to also contact relevant supervisory authorities if they feel their rights have been compromised [2][12].

---

## 6. Consent Management [9][4]

Robust consent management is a cornerstone of our privacy practices. We have instituted the following procedures to ensure that consent is informed, explicit, and easily withdrawable:

- **Obtaining Consent:** Upon launching the app, clear, plain-language disclosures are presented, detailing the categories of data collected and the purposes for its use. Consent is obtained through interactive prompts integrated within the App [9][4].
- **Documenting Consent:** User consent is logged and stored securely, with records maintained as mandated by applicable legal regulations [9].
- **Withdrawal of Consent:** Users can modify or revoke their consent through in-app settings or by contacting our data protection representative via email [9][4].
- **Children’s Data:** Our app is not primarily directed at children. However, if any data collection from users under a defined age threshold occurs, parental consent will be explicitly required. Detailed age thresholds and parental consent mechanisms are in place to ensure compliance with COPPA and relevant EU guidelines [2].

---

## 7. Third-Party Data Sharing [2][3]

Our privacy practices encompass the transfer of certain data to trusted third parties solely for the purpose of enhancing app functionality and user experience. In particular:

- **Analytics and Behavior Tracking:** Data is shared with providers such as Mixpanel and Smartlook to analyze usage patterns, with safeguards ensuring that the data is anonymized and utilized solely for improving app performance [2][3].
- **Payment Processing:** For subscription and in-app purchase functionality, third-party providers like RevenueCat and Superwall handle payment information under strict contractual data processing terms [2][3].
- **AI-Driven Services:** Third-party AI providers, such as those for image analysis and personalized suggestions (e.g., OpenAI and Replicate), use anonymized data and operate under their standard privacy and legal terms [2].

Appropriate contractual safeguards, including reliance on standard data processing agreements and Standard Contractual Clauses where necessary for international data transfers, are in effect [3][11].

---

## 8. International Data Transfers [2][7]

In instances where personal data may be transferred outside of the EU/EEA, Tasty AI ensures that all transfers conform to GDPR standards. This includes the utilization of recognized legal mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses to safeguard data during transmission internationally [2][7].

---

## 9. Data Retention and Deletion Policies [2][11]

Our approach to data retention is strictly governed by the principles of data minimization and purposeful storage [2][11].

- **Retention Schedules:** Personal data is retained only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described herein or to comply with legal obligations. Specific retention periods are defined for varying data categories, with regular audits to ensure adherence [2][11].
- **Deletion and Archiving:** Once data is no longer required, secure deletion or anonymization procedures are carried out. Automated deletion routines and manual reviews are performed to ensure data is not held beyond its useful lifespan [2][11].

---

## 10. Automated Decision-Making and Profiling [2][7]

Tasty AI does not engage in automated profiling or algorithmic decision-making that has a legal or similarly significant impact on end-users [2][7]. Any use of automated processes, such as generating personalized recipe suggestions, is based on general heuristics and does not result in legal effects or target-specific profiling. Should future iterations of the app incorporate such features, we will provide comprehensive disclosures and remedial options in line with legal mandates [2].

---

## 11. Security Measures [6][11]

Data security is of paramount importance to Tasty AI. We have implemented both technical and organizational measures to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of personal data received:

- **Technical Measures:** The App employs hardware-backed encryption, secure boot chains, and sandboxing in line with iOS native security features [6]. Additional measures include encryption of data in transit through protocols such as HTTPS/TLS, certificate pinning, and the use of Keychain Services for storing sensitive credentials [6].
- **Organizational Measures:** Regular security audits, AI-powered intrusion detection mechanisms, and prompt incident response protocols are in place. Furthermore, employee training in data protection ensures robust internal compliance [11].

These measures are periodically reviewed and enhanced, ensuring alignment with evolving regulatory and industry standards [6][11].

---

## 12. Updates and Changes to the Privacy Note [2]

In our commitment to continuous compliance and transparency, this Privacy Note may be updated periodically. Users will be notified of any significant changes in a timely manner via in-app notifications and email updates. The updated Privacy Note will be made available on our website and within the App, with an indication of the effective date of the new terms [2].

---

## 13. Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability [2][10]

While every effort is made to ensure the accuracy and completeness of this Data Privacy Note, Tasty AI cannot be held liable for any errors or omissions. Our practices are reflective of current legal requirements, and users are encouraged to consult legal counsel for personalized advice. In no event will Tasty AI be liable for any consequential or incidental damages arising from the use or inability to use our services, except where prohibited by statutory law [2][10].

This disclaimer is designed to provide maximum legal protection to the sole proprietor by clearly outlining the scope of responsibilities, data flows, and user rights [10].
