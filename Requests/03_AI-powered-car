**2. Introduction and Background**

The automotive industry is rapidly evolving, driven by advances in digital technology and shifting consumer expectations. Today’s vehicles are not only modes of transport but also personal spaces that blend productivity, entertainment, connectivity, and well-being. With increasing integration of digital ecosystems, premium automotive brands are uniquely positioned to redefine in-car experiences. This research aims to explore the emerging opportunities for an AI-powered in-car assistant that transcends traditional functionalities, offering seamless integration with mobility services, smart homes, and other personal digital devices.

**3. Research Objectives**

- **Identify Comprehensive Use Cases:** Develop a diverse portfolio of use cases that reflect the full spectrum of activities and interactions desired by all car occupants. This includes, but is not limited to, productivity tools, entertainment, navigation, social communication, health, and well-being.
  
- **Define the Future Mobility Ecosystem:** Examine how an in-car assistant can interact with broader ecosystem services—such as mobility integration, smart home connectivity, and personal digital devices—to enhance the overall user experience.
  
- **Establish a 10-Year Vision:** Outline a forward-looking target picture that captures the potential evolution of in-car digital experiences, free from immediate technical constraints.
  
- **Deliver Strategic Insights:** Provide actionable, top-down structured recommendations, using a McKinsey style approach that starts with overarching strategic imperatives and cascades into detailed use cases.

**4. Scope and Focus**

- **Target Audience:** The in-car assistant should cater to every occupant, turning the vehicle into a multi-functional private space.
  
- **Functional Breadth:** All user interactions and activities relevant in the context of mobility should be explored. This includes productivity, entertainment, navigation, social interaction, communication, and health and well-being services.
  
- **Ecosystem Integration:** Emphasize the assistant’s role in interfacing with external digital ecosystems (mobility services, smart home systems, personal devices) to provide a seamless, integrated experience.
  
- **Time Horizon:** The research will envision a future state 10 years ahead, focusing solely on futuristic opportunities rather than immediate prototypes or market constraints.
  
- **Exclusions:** Autonomous driving and core vehicle AI functionality are out of scope; the focus is strictly on the in-car assistant and its interactions.

---

**5. Research Questions**

To guide the inquiry, the research should address the following questions:

- **User Interaction:** What are the key activities and experiences that users seek within the private space of the car?
- **Use Case Identification:** Which specific use cases (across productivity, entertainment, navigation, social, health, etc.) can be envisioned for an AI-powered in-car assistant?
- **Ecosystem Synergy:** How can the in-car assistant effectively integrate with broader mobility services, smart homes, and personal digital ecosystems?
- **Future Outlook:** What trends and technological developments over the next 10 years will influence the evolution of the in-car digital experience?

---

**6. Methodology**

The research should be conducted using a multi-disciplinary, top-down approach inspired by McKinsey’s structured methodologies:

- **Desk and Literature Research:**  
  • Conduct a comprehensive review of industry reports, academic literature, and market analyses to understand current trends in digital mobility and in-car experiences.  
  • Map out emerging technologies and digital ecosystem trends that are likely to impact user expectations over the next decade.

- **Expert Interviews and Stakeholder Workshops:**  
  • Engage with industry experts, technology innovators, and user experience designers to gather insights on potential use cases and strategic directions.  
  • Organize ideation sessions and workshops to synthesize insights into a coherent set of use cases.

- **Competitive and Ecosystem Analysis:**  
  • Benchmark existing and emerging in-car digital experiences.  
  • Analyze integration models from related industries (smart home, mobile devices, etc.) to identify best practices.

- **Framework Development:**  
  • Develop a top-down strategic framework starting from high-level imperatives (e.g., enhancing user well-being, fostering digital connectivity) and deconstruct these into specific, actionable use cases.  
  • Ensure that the final deliverable is structured in a clear, hierarchical manner that facilitates decision-making at strategic, tactical, and operational levels.

---

**7. Deliverables**

- **Portfolio of Use Cases:**  
  A detailed, categorized portfolio of futuristic use cases for an AI-powered in-car assistant. Each use case should include:
  • A descriptive narrative outlining the user scenario  
  • Integration points with external digital ecosystems  
  • Potential benefits and value propositions for users and the automotive brand  
  • Strategic implications and alignment with future trends

- **Comprehensive Research Report:**  
  The final report should be structured in a McKinsey style, featuring:
  • An executive summary  
  • Detailed analysis sections following a top-down structured approach  



---

**8. Project Governance and Collaboration**

- **Interdisciplinary Team:**  
  The research should be undertaken by a collaborative team that includes a PhD research assistant with strong analytical and academic research capabilities, as well as a McKinsey consultant experienced in strategic consulting and structured analysis.

- **Iterative Review:**  
  Utilize iterative cycles of research, ideation, and validation to refine the use cases and strategic recommendations.
