I want to build a mobile application that helps people to relax their nervous system. It should provide tools and tactics and teach about the nervous system, especially the vagus nerve. Example use cases are. A user feels stressed and needs to relax in the moment. Or a user wants to implement relaxing habits over a while. Examples for tools and tactics include binaural beats, breathwork, meditation, but also habits such as going for a walk in nature, etc. Please research for me the best science-based and most effective tools and tactics to calm down the nervous system.
